# StravaToSheets

A Python program that uses the Strava API to fetch a user's activity data and export it to a local Excel sheet. The spreadsheet includes activity type, time spent, and kudos received.

## âš¡ Setup Instructions  

Before running the program, you must set up the Strava API. Using **Postman** is recommended, but you can also refer to the [Strava Developers Portal](https://developers.strava.com) for a more detailed guide. Please read through this whole guide before starting to set up the Strava API, feel free to come back to this guide as reference if needed.

It is also recommended to use a notepad or txt file to keep your information.

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Create a Strava API Application  

1. Go to [Strava Developers Portal](https://developers.strava.com) and click **"Create & Manage Your App"**  
2. Sign into Strava and create an API application
   - Application name will be temporary, so feel free to use anyname as a placeholder
   - You will also need an image as your Application Icon, again this can be a placeholder for now
   - As for the category of the application, Visualizer is the most fit category for this application
   - Website can be a temporary or fake website (https://example.com)
   - The Application Description can be set to whatever you'd like
   - Authorization Callback Domain has to be set to 'localhost'
4. Take note of the following credentials:
   - **Client ID** â€“ Your application ID  
   - **Client Secret** â€“ Your client secret (**keep this confidential**)  
   - **Authorization Token** â€“ Expires every six hours (**keep this confidential**)  
   - **Refresh Token** â€“ Used to generate a new authorization token (**keep this confidential**)  
   - **Rate Limits** â€“ Your application's current API request limits  
   - **Authorization Callback Domain** â€“ Set this to `localhost` during development

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Obtain an Authorization Code  

1. Open the following URL in a web browser, replacing `CLIENT_ID` with your actual client ID:  

   ```
   https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=code&scope=activity:read_all
   ```

2. The page will redirect to `localhost` (which wonâ€™t load).  
3. Copy the **authorization code** from the URL and save it:  

   ```
   Authorization Code: YOUR_CODE
   ```
Note: The URL will look something like this, where the NEW_AUTHORIZATION_CODE will be where your new authorization code will be.
```
http://localhost/?state=&code=NEW_AUTHORIZATION_CODE&scope=read,activity:read_all
```
---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Exchange the Authorization Code for Tokens  

1. Use **[Postman](https://www.postman.com)** (or any API tool) to send a `POST` request to:  

   ```
   https://www.strava.com/oauth/token?client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&code=YOUR_CODE&grant_type=authorization_code
   ```
- Be sure to replace the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET and YOUR_CODE with your client ID, client secret, and the new authorization code you got in the previous step
2. Save the returned **refresh token** and **access token**:  

   ```
   Refresh Token: REFRESH_TOKEN
   Access Token: ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
3. Install StravaGUI.py then in your downloads folder, right click StravaGUI.py and click open with, then open with python
   - Here you will be asked to put in your CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, and REFRESH_TOKEN
   - Put in your credentials in the respective boxes then press run
- Steps after this will be optional if you would like to see the unparsed information from strava and learn how to get a new authorization code.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Fetch Activities Using the Access Token  **(Optional)**

Use **Postman** to send a `GET` request:  

```
https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
```

This will return a **JSON response** containing all of the user's activities.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Refresh the Access Token  **(Optional)**

Since the access token expires, use the refresh token to generate a new one.  
Send a `POST` request to:  

```
https://www.strava.com/oauth/token?client_id=CLIENT_ID&client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET&refresh_token=REFRESH_TOKEN&grant_type=refresh_token
```

- This will return a **new access token** and inform you of its expiration time.  
- The **refresh token does not expire**, so you can keep using it to get new access tokens.

## ðŸš€ Running the Program  (Alternate Method)

Once setup is complete:  

1. Open `StravaToSheets.py` using any kind of IDE   
2. Replace `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `REFRESH_TOKEN` with your credentials  
3. Run the script   

The program will generate an **Excel spreadsheet** with:  
âœ” **Activity list** (most recent to least)  
âœ” **Activity name, type, and duration**  
âœ” **Kudos received**  
âœ” **Summary page** with total kudos and total time spent  
âœ” **Kudos Per Month** chart with kudos recieved per month   
âœ” **Activities Per Month** chart with all logged activities per month   
âœ” **Kudos vs Activities Per Month** chart to compare activities logged and kudos gained per month   
âœ” **Activities Map** that contains every activity with GPS map information logged on your Strava profile   

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Notes  

- The setup process is **one-time only**; the script will handle token refreshing automatically.  
- Keep your **Client Secret, Authorization Token, and Refresh Token confidential** to prevent unauthorized access.
- Make sure you have all the libraries used in the python file, use the following command in command prompt to ensure they are installed

```
py -m pip install --force-reinstall requests urllib3 pandas openpyxl folium polyline tk
```
